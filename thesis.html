      <h4>Nonlinear Cooperative Differential Game Theory for physical Human-Robot Interaction</h4>
      <p>
        Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interactions among rational agents.
        It was proven that also in physical Human-Robot Interaction game theory provides a useful tool for modeling and control of the robot.
        Many studies investigates the Linear case, this thesis wants to investigate the nonlinear case, implements possible solutions and verify the method on a real robotic platform.

      <h4>Inverse Optimal Control/Inverse Reinforcement Learning for physical Human-Robot Interaction </h4>
      <p>
        Optimal control aims at minimizing a cost function to provide optimal control input. Conversely, Inverse Optimal Control seeks the cost function that produced a known control input, given such control input and state history.
        The objective of the thesis is to recover the cost function of a human performing a shared task with a robot, and analysis of the data to understand and analyze if the human prefers a Cooperative or Non-Cooperative behavior of the robot.
        This will allow future applications to design controllers for more natural Human-Robot Interaction.

        The main activities will be: 
        <ol> 
          <li> 
            identification of the cost function’s relevant features (i.e., cost function’s structure)
          </li>
          <li>
            implementation of IOC/IRL algorithms and selection of the best one

          <li>
            design of experiments and data collection with a robot.
          </li>
          <li>
            analysis of the data to understand which model fits better (cooperative/non-cooperative/others)

      <h4>IOC to understand human behavior</h4>
      <p>
        Optimal control aims at minimizing a cost function to provide optimal control input. Conversely, Inverse Optimal Control seeks the cost function that produced a known control input, given such control input and state history.
        The objective of the thesis is to recover the cost function of a humans' dyad performing a shared task, and analysis of the data to understand if their behavior can be described by Cooperative or Non-Cooperative game theory or other models (to be identified), and which better fits.
        This will allow future applications to design controllers for more natural Human-Robot Interaction.

      <h4>Learning role arbitration between Human and Robot</h4>
      <p>
        Role Arbitration defines the mechanism that assigns control of a shared task to either the human or the robot. In a shared task between a human and a robot, it is important to select who has the control authority.
        The objective of this thesis is to define a law that allows smooth and continuous role arbitration between a human and a robot.
        Possible features to be considered can be minimum jerk, safety requirements, foreseen collisions.

        The main activities will be: 
        <ol> 
          <li> 
            identification and optimization of the role arbitration law (possible techniques are Fuzzy logic, reinforcement learning)
          </li>
          <li>
            Design of experiments and implementation of the control law on a real robot
          </li>
          <li>
            Data collection and analysis to compare the proposed approach with other states of the art
            approaches
          </li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        Note: preferred skills (can also be acquired during the thesis):
        <li> Python/C++</li>
