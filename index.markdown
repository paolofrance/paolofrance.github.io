My name is Paolo Franceschi.
I am currently a reseracher at [Istituto Dalle Molle di studi sull'intelligenza artificiale (IDSIA-USI-SUPSI)](https://www.idsia.usi-supsi.ch/), in the group of Prof. Loris Roveda.
  
I received a B.Sc. in aerospace engineering and an M.Sc. in mechanical engineering from [Politecnico of Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en)  in 2015 and 2017, respectively.  
During my studies, I had the opportunity to work on my master thesis project at the  [IBM Almaden Research Center](https://research.ibm.com/labs/almaden) in San Jos&egrave;, California.
There I spent about six months developing a bipedal platform. My main activities were modeling the bipedal robot and implementing control strategies to allow robust walking.  
From January 2018 to September 2023, I have been a research fellow at the [Institute of Intelligent Industrial Technologies and Systems for Advanced Manufacturing (STIIMA-CNR)](https://www.stiima.cnr.it/?lang=en), under the supervision of Dr. Nicola Pedrocchi and Dr. Loris Roveda. 
My main research focuses are interaction control and workspace optimization for manipulating and assembling large objects.  
I was involved in the [H2020 EURECA project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/649972) (2028-2020), aiming to automatize the assembly of the airplane's interior. 
I was also involved in the [H2020 DrapeBot project](https://www.drapebot.eu/) (2021-2024), where I developed controllers for the shared transport of carbon fiber plies.   
From November 2020 to November 2023, I have also been a Ph.D. student at the department of Mechanical Engineering of the University of Brescia (UniBs), in the [Automatic Control for Intelligent Robots (CARI)](https://cari.unibs.it/) lab under the supervision of Prof. Manuel Beschi.
There, I worked on developing control for physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI). The main topic addressed were modeling human behavior, modeling ionteraction with a Game-Theoretic framework, and the dynamic leader-follower role arbitration between human and robot.

From October 2023 to June 2025 I have been a researcher at SUPSI in Lugano. I was involved in the [Horizon Europe Fluently](https://www.fluently-horizonproject.eu/) project, where I study learning methods for teaching robots new tasks.  


Since July 2025, I am Researcher at [Istituto Dalle Molle di studi sull'intelligenza artificiale (IDSIA-USI-SUPSI)](https://www.idsia.usi-supsi.ch/), in the group of Prof. Loris Roveda.
