            About myself
    </div>

    <div class="info col-sm-12" >
        I received the Bsc in aerospace engineering and the Msc in mechanical engineering, bolth from Politecnico of Milano,
         in 2015 and 2017, respectively.
        During my studies I had the opportunity to work on my master thesis project at IBM Almaden Research Center, in San Jos&egrave;, California.
        There I spent about six month developing a bipedal platfom. My main activities were model the bipedal robot, and implement basic control strategies to allow robust walking.
        Since January 2018 I am research fellow at STIIMA-CNR. My main reseach focuses are interaction control and workspace optimization for the manipulation and assembly of large objects. 
        Since November 2020 I am also a Ph.D. student with the University of Brescia (UniBs), where I am focussing in developing control for physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) based on game theory.
