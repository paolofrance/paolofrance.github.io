            My name is Paolo Franceschi. <br>
            I received a B.Sc. in aerospace engineering and an M.Sc. in mechanical engineering from Politecnico of Milano in 2015 and 2017, respectively. <br>
            During my studies, I had the opportunity to work on my master thesis project at IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jos&egrave;, California.
            There I spent about six months developing a bipedal platform. My main activities were modeling the bipedal robot and implementing basic control strategies to allow robust walking. <br>
            Since January 2018, I have been a research fellow at STIIMA-CNR. My main research focuses are interaction control and workspace optimization for manipulating and assembling large objects. <br>
            I was involved in the H2020 Eureca project, aiming to automatize the assembly of the airplane's interior. (2018-2020) <br>
            I am currently involved in the <a href="https://www.drapebot.eu/">H2020 DrapeBot project</a> (2021-2024), where I am developing controllers for the shared transport of carbon fiber plies. <br> 
            Since November 2020, I have also been a Ph.D. student at the University of Brescia (UniBs), where I am focussing on developing control for physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) based on game theory.
